My research interests combine the development and analysis of
mathematical models and of the ensuing numerical methods for the
simulation of natural phenomena. I consider my work to be at the
interface between applied mathematics and applications, and my
personal aspirations is to contribute with my expertise to the
solution of problems with social and environmental impacts.


## Research Interests

* <b>Scalar-, Vector- and Tensor-valued surface PDEs:</b> development
  of numerical methods adapted to the geometry for PDEs on surfaces
  (intrinsic finite volumes, Discontinuous Galerkin, surface finite
  element, high-order virtual element methods). Applications to
  surface fluid flows, including shallow water equations and two-phase
  flow with curvature effects on stationary and evolving surfaces.
  
* Modeling of <b>Intrinsic Shallow Water Equations (ISWE) on fixed and
  moving surfaces:</b> modeling and development of numerical methods
  to solve ISWE (finite volumes with Eulerian and Lagrangian-Eulerian
  approach, discontinuous Galerkin scheme, continuous Galerkin with
  entropy-viscosity stabilization).
  
* <b>Coupling of 1D, 2D and 3D models:</b> formulation and numerical
solution of geometrically intrinsic models of two-dimensional overland
flows for coupled surface-subsurface hydrological applications;
numerical modeling of flow and transport equations in porous media
with strong anisotropy; development of unfitted methods for embedded
low-dimensional features.
