My research interests combine the development and analysis of
mathematical models and of the ensuing numerical methods for the
simulation of natural phenomena. I consider my work to be at the
interface between applied mathematics and applications, and my
personal aspirations is to contribute with my expertise to the
solution of problems with social and environmental impacts.


## Research Interests * <b>Development of numerical methods adapted to
the geometry for PDEs on surfaces</b>: intrinsic surface finite
elements methods, high-order virtual elements method, unfitted methods
for embedded low-dimensional features.

* Modeling of <b>Intrinsic Shallow Water Equations (ISWE)</b> on fixed and moving surfaces and development of numerical methods to solve ISWE (finite volumes with Eulerian and Lagrangian-Eulerian approach, discontinuous Galerkin scheme, continuous Galerkin with entropy-viscosity stabilization).

* Numerical modeling of <b>flow and transport equations in porous media</b> (two and three dimensional cases): study of strong anisotropic cases, coupling of surface and subsurface processes.

* <b>Vector- and Tensor-valued surface PDEs</b>: numerical methods for surface fluids, numerical modeling of two-phase flow including curvature effects on stationary and evolving surfaces.
