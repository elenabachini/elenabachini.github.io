I am a Research Associate at the Institute of Scientific Computing at TU Dresden, Germany (2021).
  
I received the Bachelor degree from the University of Pisa
(Italy) in 2013 and the Master degree from the University
of Padua (Italy) in 2016, both in Mathematics.
I then pursued the Doctoral degree in Mathematical Sciences
(Curriculum Computational Mathematics) from the University of
Padua (Italy) in 2020.

My PhD thesis was focused on the modeling of shallow-water equations
on general topography and on the implementation of suitable
numerical schemes.

After the PhD, in 2020, I collaborated with the Department of
Geosciences at the University of Padua, working on the modeling of 2D
and 3D flow and transport equations in porous media in the presence of
anisotropy. I was a Postoctoral fellow in the project "Development of
a numerical model for the solution of strongly anisotropic flow and
transport equations in porous media" (PI Prof. M. Ghinassi).
Since April 2021, I am holding the current position at the Institute of
Scientific Computing at TU Dresden (Germany), working in the research
project group "FOR3013: Vector and Tensor Valued Surface PDEs" (PI
Prof. A. Voigt).
