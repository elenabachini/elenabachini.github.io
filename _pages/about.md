I am a <b>fixed-term junior assistant professor</b> at the Department of Mathematics "Tullio Levi-Civita", University of Padua (Italy).
  
I received the <b>Bachelor degree</b> from the University of Pisa, Italy (2013) and the <b>Master degree</b> from the University of Padua, Italy (2016), both in Mathematics. I then pursued the <b>Doctoral degree</b> in Mathematical Sciences (Curriculum Computational Mathematics) from the University of Padua, Italy (2020).

After the PhD, in 2020, I collaborated as <b>postdoctoral fellow</b> with the Department of Geosciences at the University of Padua, working on the modeling of 2D and 3D flow and transport equations in porous media in the presence of anisotropy. From April 2021 to March 2023, I was <b>Research Associate</b> at the Institute of Scientific Computing at TU Dresden (Germany), working in the research project group ["FOR3013: Vector and Tensor Valued Surface PDEs"](https://for3013.webspace.tu-dresden.de/). Since April 2023, I am holding the current position, within the [“RETURN - multi-Risk sciEnce for resilienT commUnities undeR a changiNg climate”](https://www.fondazionereturn.it/) project, MUR-PNRR Extended Partnership PE5, funded by Next-Generation EU.
