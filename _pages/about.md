I am a Research Associate at the Institute of Scientific Computing at
TU Dresden, Germany (2021).
  
I received the Bachelor degree from the University of Pisa, Italy (2013)
and the Master degree from the University
of Padua, Italy (2016), both in Mathematics.
I then pursued the Doctoral degree in Mathematical Sciences
(Curriculum Computational Mathematics) from the University of
Padua, Italy (2020).

My [PhD thesis](https://dottorato.math.unipd.it/sites/default/files/tesi_Elena_Bachini.pdf) was focused on the modeling of shallow-water equations
on general topography and on the implementation of suitable
numerical schemes.

After the PhD, in 2020, I collaborated as postdoctoral fellow with the
Department of Geosciences at the University of Padua, working on the
modeling of 2D and 3D flow and transport equations in porous media in
the presence of anisotropy. Since April 2021, I am holding the current
position at the Institute of Scientific Computing at TU Dresden
(Germany), working in the research project group ["FOR3013: Vector and
Tensor Valued Surface PDEs"](https://for3013.webspace.tu-dresden.de/).
