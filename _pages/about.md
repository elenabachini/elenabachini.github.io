I am a <b>Research Associate</b> at the Institute of Scientific Computing at TU Dresden, Germany (2021).
  
I received the <b>Bachelor degree</b> from the University of Pisa, Italy (2013) and the <b>Master degree</b> from the University of Padua, Italy (2016), both in Mathematics. I then pursued the <b>Doctoral degree</b> in Mathematical Sciences (Curriculum Computational Mathematics) from the University of Padua, Italy (2020).

My PhD thesis was focused on the modeling of shallow-water equations on general topography and on the implementation of suitable numerical schemes.

After the PhD, in 2020, I collaborated as <b>postdoctoral fellow</b> with the Department of Geosciences at the University of Padua, working on the modeling of 2D and 3D flow and transport equations in porous media in the presence of anisotropy. Since April 2021, I am holding the <b>current position</b> at the Institute of Scientific Computing at TU Dresden (Germany), working in the research project group ["FOR3013: Vector and Tensor Valued Surface PDEs"](https://for3013.webspace.tu-dresden.de/).
